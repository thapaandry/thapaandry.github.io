  The world’s highest mountain above the mean sea level at 8,848 metres (29,029 ft). It is located in the Himalayas on the Nepal (Sagarmatha Zone)-China (Tibet) border. One of the most popular area for trekking in Nepal. Trek to Everest base camp is mystique derived from its soaring giant, ever panoramic peaks and the extreme adventures of legendary mountaineers. The Everest, situated in the Solu and Khumbu diversified district is justifiably renowned, not only because it encompasses Mount Everest, <br><br>the world’s highest mountain (8850m), but also because of its exotic Sherpa villages and monasteries, flora and fauna. The main goal of many Everest trekking is to trek to Everest Base Camp at an elevation of about 5430m.</p>

  The history of the city of Kathmandu, which is inseparable from that of the Kathmandu valley, n 1992, workers digging a trench for the foundation of a house in Maligaon in Eastern Kathmandu discovered a life size (171 x 49 cm) standing male figure carved in pale sandstone, clearly made in the Kushan style. The sculpture was donated by an early Licchavi or pre-Licchavi monarch, named Jaya Varman with an inscription on the pedestal. Although the identity of the figure is contested, it is the authors'[who?] opinion that it is likely Jaya Varman himself who is portrayed.<br><br> It is the oldest known inscription from the Kathmandu Valley. The inscription on this sculpture, clearly dated to samvat 107, most likely corresponding to AD 185, provides this previously missing evidence, and pushes back the epigraphical documentation of royal rule in the Kathmandu valley nearly three hundred years.[2]dates back to ancient times.[1] Archaeological explorations indicate that Kathmandu and the two other sister towns in the valley were the oldest towns and are traced to the period between 167 BC and 1 AD. Excavations conducted at Hadigaon and Lubhu in southern part of the valley, in Kathmandu, have unearthed brick walls and Stone Age tools.>
