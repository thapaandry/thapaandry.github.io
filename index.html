One of the most popular area for trekking in Nepal. Trek to Everest base camp is mystique derived from its soaring giant, ever panoramic peaks and the extreme adventures of legendary mountaineers. The Everest, situated in the Solu and Khumbu diversified district is justifiably renowned, not only because it encompasses Mount Everest, <br><br>the world’s highest mountain (8850m), but also because of its exotic Sherpa villages and monasteries, flora and fauna. The main goal of many Everest trekking is to trek to Everest Base Camp at an elevation of about 5430m.</p>

  The history of the city of Kathmandu, which is inseparable from that of the Kathmandu valley, n 1992, workers digging a trench for the foundation of a house in Maligaon in Eastern Kathmandu discovered a life size (171 x 49 cm) standing male figure carved in pale sandstone, clearly made in the Kushan style. The sculpture was donated by an early Licchavi or pre-Licchavi monarch, named Jaya Varman with an inscription on the pedestal. Although the identity of the figure is contested, it is the authors'[who?] opinion that it is likely Jaya Varman himself who is portrayed.<br><br> It is the oldest known inscription from the Kathmandu Valley. The inscription on this sculpture, clearly dated to samvat 107, most likely corresponding to AD 185, provides this previously missing evidence, and pushes back the epigraphical documentation of royal rule in the Kathmandu valley nearly three hundred years.[2]dates back to ancient times.[1] Archaeological explorations indicate that Kathmandu and the two other sister towns in the valley were the oldest towns and are traced to the period between 167 BC and 1 AD. Excavations conducted at Hadigaon and Lubhu in southern part of the valley, in Kathmandu, have unearthed brick walls and Stone Age tools.>

        <p>London /ˈlʌndən/ (About this sound listen) is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.[7][8]<br>

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.[9] London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[10][11][12] which today largely makes up Greater London,[13][14][note 1] a region governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[15][note 2][16]<br>

London is a leading global city[17][18] in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation.[19][20][21] It is crowned as the world's largest financial centre[22][23] [24][25] and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world.[note 3] [26][27] London is a world cultural capital.[28][29][30] It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals[31] and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic.[32] London is the world's leading investment destination,[33][34][35][36] hosting more international retailers[37][38] and ultra high-net-worth individuals[39][40] than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[41] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.[42]</p>
